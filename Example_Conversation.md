### _Chatting mode_ 

ðŸ˜Ž user          : what is the smallest planet ?

ðŸ‘» assistant     : The smallest planet in our solar system is Mercury. It is about 4,879 kilometers (3,032 miles) in diameter, making it slightly larger than Earth's moon.

ðŸ˜Ž user          : how small is it?

ðŸ‘» assistant     : Mercury has a diameter of approximately 4,879 kilometers (3,032 miles). To put it into perspective, Mercury is about 38% the size of Earth. It is the smallest planet in our solar system.

### _Making a Google Search_

ðŸ˜Ž User          : who is the president of USA?

ðŸ‘¿ ChatGPT decided to Function to be used: search_in_google

ðŸ‘» AI            : According to the information available, as of my last update on July 20, 2023, Joe Biden is the current President of the United States. He assumed office on January 20, 2021.

### _Asking something ChatGPT doesn't know (Writing python code to disk)_

ðŸ˜Ž User          : try to make a guess for the smallest prime number which is bigger than 10 to the power of 16?

ðŸ‘» assistant     : To find the smallest prime number larger than 10^16, we can start checking numbers from 10^16 + 1 and continue incrementing until we find a prime number. However, this process can be computationally intensive and may take a long time to complete. Would you like me to proceed with this calculation?       

ðŸ˜Ž user          : no, please write a python code instead

ðŸ‘» assistant     :
The Code is as follows:
```python
import sympy

# starting from 10^16 + 1
def smallest_prime():
    number = 10**16 + 1
    while True:
        if sympy.isprime(number):
            return number
        else:
            number += 1

print(smallest_prime())
```

ðŸ‘» File written as .codes\smallest_prime.py.

ðŸ˜Ž user          : can you run that code 

ðŸ‘» assistant     : Error. Return Code: 1

Error:pydevd_bundle\pydevd_runpy.py", line 124, in _run_code
    exec(code, run_globals)
  File ".codes\smallest_prime.py", line 1, in <module>
    import sympy
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sympy'

### _Trying again_

ðŸ˜Ž user          : ok, please write the code without using sympy library

ðŸ‘» assistant     : Certainly! Here's an updated version of the code that does not rely on the `sympy` library:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def smallest_prime():
    number = 10**16 + 1
    while True:
        if is_prime(number):
            return number
        else:
            number += 1

print(smallest_prime())
```

ðŸ‘» File written as .codes\smallest_prime_v2.py.


ðŸ˜Ž user          : thank you, please run this v2 version

ðŸ‘» assistant     : The executed program smallest_prime_v2.py gave the result:
10000000000000061

ðŸ˜Ž user          : wow. that is a big number

ðŸ‘» assistant     : Yes, indeed! The smallest prime number larger than 10^16 is 10000000000000061. Prime numbers can get quite large, and they play a crucial role in many areas of mathematics and cryptography.
